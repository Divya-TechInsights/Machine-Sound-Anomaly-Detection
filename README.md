🧠 Tech Stack: Python | Streamlit | TensorFlow | Librosa | Pandas | NumPy




## 🧠 Overview  

**Machine Sound Anomaly Detection** is an AI-powered web application that identifies abnormal machine behavior based on sound patterns.  
By analyzing audio signals using **Deep Learning** and **Signal Processing**, this project helps in **predictive maintenance** — detecting faults before they cause costly downtime.  



## ⚙️ Key Features  

- 🎵 **Audio Analysis** – Extracts features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from machine sound.  
- 🤖 **Deep Learning Model** – Classifies normal vs. abnormal machine states using trained neural networks.  
- 📊 **Interactive Streamlit App** – User-friendly interface for uploading and testing machine audio.  
- 🔔 **Real-Time Detection** – Instantly predicts anomaly status with visualization.  



## 🧩 Technologies Used  

- **Python**  
- **Streamlit** (for web interface)  
- **Librosa** (for audio feature extraction)  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for machine learning model)  
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data processing)  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)  



## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Upload a machine sound file** (in `.wav` format).  
2. The app extracts key **audio features** using `librosa`.  
3. The trained model analyzes the sound and classifies it as **Normal** or **Anomalous**.  
4. The result is displayed instantly along with relevant metrics.  



## 🧾 Use Case  

This project is ideal for:  
- Industrial equipment monitoring  
- Predictive maintenance systems  
- Factory automation  
- Smart manufacturing solutions
